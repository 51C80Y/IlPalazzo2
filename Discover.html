          The Village of Sassetta located in the Tuscan countryside, only 20 minutes from the beach, with houses uniquely perched on a hill. The village is made up of beautifully typical Tuscan narrow streets, small squares and spectacular views.
          The town is famous for its marble which is unique to the area.
          Close by, thermal waters flow from inland, emerging at almost 50Â°, offering the possibility to experience this natural form of relaxation at the nearby SPA " la Cerreta Terme"  just a few kilometers from the villag</p>

          For Nature Lovers, a few km from the town  the nature park " Poggio Neri" offers a series of treks with various points of interest and picnic areas. Among these, the "Botanical Route", which is accessible even to people with motor disabilities. The park also hosts the "Forest museum" where examples and information about the daily life and professions of the chestnut pickers are represented, while the "via del carbone" (charcoal path)  shows the ancient profession and technique used to make coal.
