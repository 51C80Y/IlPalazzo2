          For Nature Lovers, a few km from the town  the nature park " Poggio Neri" offers a series of treks with various points of interest and picnic areas. Among these, the "Botanical Route", which is accessible even to people with motor disabilities. The park also hosts the "Forest museum" where examples and information about the daily life and professions of the chestnut pickers are represented, while the "via del carbone" (charcoal path)  shows the ancient profession and technique used to make coal.

      <p id="campiglia">
        "Starting from the village of Campiglia, you can reach "Monte Calvi" (Mount Calvi), to enjoy an incredible 360° panoramic view. These paths are located mainly in the woods, with the occasional stunning view of the Etruscan Coast and surrounding islands. On the way back,
         why not stop in the ancient village of Campiglia and discover its rich history and typical Italian narrow streets. Or maybe to explore 'la Rocca' (the old castle) and enjoy the spectacular landscape, grab a bite at the bakery or try the famous  "Schiaccia Campigliese!" The walk is about 4.h but it is suitable for all to enjoy!"
