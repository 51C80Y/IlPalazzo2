    <h1>About the House</h1> 
        <p> Il Palazzo, located just on top of the hill of "Le Fornaci" is an old Tuscan House that has been restored and divided into three apartment-rooms,
            each with a private bathroom and a kitchenette to prepare cold meals.
            The fourth room, a communal Kitchen with a cosy living space and a wood burner is available to all guests during their stay.

        <h1>The Restoration</h1>
        <p> The House has been completely restored in 2024.
            As we did the majority of the work ourselves, we have tried our best to use local and traditional methods throughout the restoration.
            This includes using lime and chalk for plastering, painting and brick work. Each bathroom has been newly constructed using Hemp Lime bricks and the walls/floors
            finished whit "pastellone".
            This material and building technique is an ancient one, already used in Roman times which finds its maximum expression in the sixteenth-century Venice, 
            as the forerunner of the venetian "terrazzo"
            Check out our Youtube channel to see the entire restoration.
