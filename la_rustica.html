        <h2>La Rustica</h2>
        <p> Located on the second floor of The Palazzo, "La Rustica" (the rustic) gives you a first hand experience and feeling of originality
            of when and how the building was constructed, restored and renovated original chestnut beams as well as an exposed brickwork wall really allow
            yout to feel the essence of the building.</p>
        
        <h3>About the House</h3> 
        <p> Il Palazzo, located just on top of the hill of "Le Fornaci" is an old Tuscan House that has been restored and divided into three apartment-rooms,
            each whit a private bathroom and a kitchenette to prepare cold meals.
            The fourth room, a communal Kitchen whit a cosy living space and a wood burner is available to all guests during their stay.
            All the rooms offer a beautiful view over the local Tuscan woods.</p>
       
   
    
        <h3>The Restoration</h3>
        <p> The House has been completely restored in 2024.
            As we did the majority of the work ourselves, we have tried our best to use local and traditional methods throughout the restoration.
            This includes using lime and chalk for plastering, painting and brick work. Each bathroom has been newly constructed using Hemp Lime bricks and the walls/floors
            finished whit "pastellone".
            This material and building technique is an ancient one, already used in Roman times which finds its maximum expression in the sixteenth-century Venice, 
            as the forerunner of the venetian "terrazzo"
            Check out our Youtube channel to see the entire restoration.

          <h3>The Rooms</h3>
        <p> Every room comes whit a unique private bathroom,
            fully furnished, whit towels and linen. The kitchenette in the rooms is equipped whit all the necessities for small meals and includes
            a kettle, sink and a fridge. " La Due"  and "La Drago" also are equipped whit a wood burner for the colder winter months.
            High speed Wifi available in all rooms.
